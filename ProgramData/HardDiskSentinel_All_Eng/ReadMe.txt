Some antivirus can detect this release as a threat and try to remove it. The    
reason for this is because my releases are packed/protected in order to reduce  
its size and avoid alterations to the code. This protection can be erroneously  
identified as a threat, it is what is commonly known as a FALSE POSITIVE. Just  
ignore it, it is safe to use.                                                   
                                                                                
IMPORTANT: there will be no risk when using my releases as long as you have     
downloaded it from the links posted on my site or from the "Check for Updates"  
option. If you have downloaded this release from another site, I CANNOT         
GUARANTEE ITS INTEGRITY. In such case, I will not take responsability for       
eventual problems that arise when using it. Be careful!                         
                                                                                
As a precaution, always check the release hashes.
